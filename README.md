# War Card Game

A classic two-player card game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Battle against an opponent to claim the entire deck!

## How to Play

- Each player draws one card per round.
- The player with the higher card wins the round and takes both cards.
- If both cards are of equal value, it's **WAR**:
  - Each player places three cards face down and then flips a fourth.
  - The higher fourth card wins all the cards on the table.
  - If there's another tie, the WAR repeats.

The game continues until one player collects the **entire deck**.

## Built With
